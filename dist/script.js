//Represents any type. It allows you to assign any value to a variable.

//Similar to Any, but it also allows you to assign any value to a variable.

//Never
//Represents the type of values that never occur.

//Represents the type of values that never have a value.

//Push Loophole Explanation
/*In TypeScript, arrays or tuples can lead to a "push loophole" when you specify multiple types for an array or tuple.
If you declare an array or tuple with a union of types, TypeScript allows you to push any of the specified types into the array.*/
//Example with an array:
let mixedArray = [1, "hello"];
mixedArray.push(42); // Valid
mixedArray.push("world"); // Valid
//Example with a tuple:
let mixedTuple = [1, "hello"];
mixedTuple.push(42); // Valid but unexpected for tuples
mixedTuple.push("world"); // Valid but unexpected for tuples
//Why is it a loophole?
/* For arrays, itâ€™s intentional that you can push either type. However, for tuples, which are meant to have a fixed structure,
allowing push to add elements breaks the intended fixed-length constraint.This loophole occurs because tuples are essentially
arrays under the hood in JavaScript. TypeScript allows the push method, which isn't type-checked for fixed-length in tuples,
to add elements beyond the specified length. */
