//Basics Types
// Number, String, Boolean (haves a push loop hole )
// Arrays,Tuples
// Any, Unknown, Never, Void
// Enums

//Number
let age: number = 20;
let rollno: number = 78;

//String
 let a: string = "John Doe";
 let address: string = "123 Main St";

 //Boolean
let isValid: boolean = false
let isValidString: boolean = true

//Arrays
 let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 let fruits: string[] = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];

 //Tuples
 let person: [string, number, boolean] = ["John Doe", 20, false];   

 //Any
 //Represents any type. It allows you to assign any value to a variable.
 let myVariable: any = 10;
 myVariable = "Hello World";

 //Unknown
 //Similar to Any, but it also allows you to assign any value to a variable.
 //However, it doesn't have the push loop hole that Any has.
 let myVariable2: unknown = 10;
 myVariable2 = "Hello World";

 //Never
 //Represents the type of values that never occur.
 function error(message: string): never {
    throw new Error(message);
 }

 //Void
 //Represents the type of values that never have a value.
 function log(): void {
    console.log("This function doesn't return anything");
 }

 //Enums
enum Direction {
    Up = 1,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right
}

let move: Direction = Direction.Up; // This will set 'move' to 1 (Direction.Up).


 //Push Loophole Explanation
/*In TypeScript, arrays or tuples can lead to a "push loophole" when you specify multiple types for an array or tuple. 
If you declare an array or tuple with a union of types, TypeScript allows you to push any of the specified types into the array.*/

//Example with an array:

let mixedArray: (number | string)[] = [1, "hello"];
mixedArray.push(42); // Valid
mixedArray.push("world"); // Valid

//Example with a tuple:

let mixedTuple: [number, string] = [1, "hello"];
mixedTuple.push(42); // Valid but unexpected for tuples
mixedTuple.push("world"); // Valid but unexpected for tuples


//Why is it a loophole?
/* For arrays, itâ€™s intentional that you can push either type. However, for tuples, which are meant to have a fixed structure, 
allowing push to add elements breaks the intended fixed-length constraint.This loophole occurs because tuples are essentially
arrays under the hood in JavaScript. TypeScript allows the push method, which isn't type-checked for fixed-length in tuples, 
to add elements beyond the specified length. */
